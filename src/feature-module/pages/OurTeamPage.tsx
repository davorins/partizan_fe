                  <h2 className='mb-2 text-center'>Our Coaching Philosophy</h2>
                  <p className='mb-2'>
                    At Partizan, we believe that basketball is more than just a
                    game – it’s an opportunity for growth, development, and
                    personal excellence. Our coaching philosophy is grounded in
                    the following principles:
                  </p>
                  <ul className='mb-5'>
                    <li className='mb-2'>
                      <strong>Skill Development:</strong> We prioritize
                      individual skill development in all aspects of the game,
                      including shooting, ball-handling, passing, defense, and
                      more.
                    </li>
                    <li className='mb-2'>
                      <strong>Teamwork and Collaboration:</strong> We emphasize
                      the importance of teamwork, communication, and
                      collaboration both on and off the court. Campers learn to
                      work together, support each other, and celebrate success
                      as a team.
                    </li>
                    <li className='mb-2'>
                      <strong>Sportsmanship and Respect:</strong> We instill
                      values of sportsmanship, respect, and integrity in our
                      campers, teaching them to compete with honor and respect
                      for their opponents, coaches, and officials.
                    </li>
                    <li className='mb-2'>
                      <strong>Fun and Positive Environment:</strong> We believe
                      that learning and improvement are most effective in a fun,
                      positive, and supportive environment. Our coaches strive
                      to create an atmosphere where campers feel motivated,
                      encouraged, and inspired to do their best.
