                  Zlatko's basketball career started in Belgrade, Serbia, in

                  learned Yugoslavian basketball style, structure, and
                  fundamentals. Former Yugoslavia is a famous, successful, and
                  proud nation producing some of the World's greatest basketball
                  players like Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, Vlade Divac, Drazen
                  Petrovic, and many others.

                  continued basketball at Everett High School in Everett,

                  awarded WESCO Player of the Year Award and was nominated to
                  the Washington State All Star Team alongside former NBA player
                  and current NBA analyst Jamal Crawford.
                </p>
                <p>

                  University he averaged 14.6 points/game, 4.1 rebounds/game and
                  4.1 assists/game and was nominated to All-Patriot League First

                  Playing at the High School level, Division I level, and
                  professionally in Europe, has reinforced his knowledge and
                  deep understanding of systems, player development, and mental
                  demands that are required from basketball players today. He
                  also understands the importance of education and its emphasis

                  His coaching philosophy emphasizes fundamentals,

                  ensuring that every athlete is prepared not just for the next
                  level of basketball, but for life beyond the game! Above all,

                  of Partizan AAU Basketball. He is dedicated to developing
                  young athletes through high-level skill training, discipline,
                  and a strong basketball culture built around fundamentals,

                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Background & Playing Career</strong>
                  <br />
                  Originally from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Armend grew up in the
                  European basketball system that is known for demanding
                  practices, strong fundamentals, and a team-oriented
                  philosophy. Growing up in the former Yugoslavia, he trained
                  daily in a system that emphasized skill development,
                  basketball IQ, and understanding the game at a deep level.
                  Those early years shaped his work ethic and passion for
                  basketball.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Armend continued his basketball journey in the United States
                  where he played NCAA Division I basketball at the University
                  of Idaho. Competing at the highest level of college basketball
                  allowed him to gain valuable experience against elite
                  competition and further expand his understanding of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following his collegiate career, Armend continued playing
                  professionally in Europe, competing for several teams across
                  the continent, including clubs in Greece and the Balkans.
                  Playing internationally allowed him to experience different
                  basketball systems, coaching philosophies, and styles of play,
                  which continue to influence the way he teaches the game today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Coaching Philosophy</strong>
                  <br />
                  Today, Armend brings his international experience and
                  knowledge to youth basketball through Partizan AAU. His
                  coaching philosophy blends the structured fundamentals of
                  European basketball with the athleticism and competitiveness
                  of the American game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Armend, it is extremely important that young players
                  develop creativity on the court. He believes players must have
                  the freedom to play instinctively, make decisions, and express
                  their game naturally. At the same time, he demands discipline,
                  effort, and accountability. Players are expected to compete
                  hard, play with energy, and hustle on every possession.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through Partizan AAU, Armend is committed to helping players
                  grow not only as basketball athletes but also as individuals.
                  His goal is to develop confident, skilled, and intelligent
                  players who understand the game and carry strong work habits
                  both on and off the court.
